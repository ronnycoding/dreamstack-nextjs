# TELOS NextJS dApp Starter

NextJS framework for TELOS and EOSIO dApps. Take the pain out of creating Universal React apps with blockchain integration.

## NextJS

Next.js extends React to provide a powerful method for loading a page's initial data, no matter where it is coming from. With a single place to prepopulate page context, server-side rendering with Next.js seamlessly integrates with any existing data-fetching strategy.

Next.js performs server-side rendering by default. This makes your application optimized for search engines. Also, you can integrate any middleware such as express.js or Hapi.js, and you can run any database such as MongoDB or MySQL.

Lift, Binance, Hulu, Leafly, Hashnode, Twitch, Elastic, Expo, Ferrari and Marvel are using server side rendering with NextJS.

### Server Side Rendering

- Superior performance and search engine optimization.

## NextJS vs Gatsby

Use Next.js for Apps, Gatsby for Websites.
